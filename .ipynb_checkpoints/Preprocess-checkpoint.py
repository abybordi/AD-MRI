# Here is the plan:

# 1. determine optimal scan ID's for each participant. (scan_ID.py)

# 2. Try to download batch of 20 scans
    #2a. see which scans were downloaded. Append not downloaded scans to "bad" csv

# 3. load and preprocess (spatial + intensity normalize)

# 4. visual inspection.py, ask for response "good" or "bad"
