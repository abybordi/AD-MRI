        "The model presented incorporates a volumetric convolutional autoencoder to learn features that are useful in classifying images as either CN or AD. Furthermore, an alternative model is presented with similar 3D convolutional autoencoder design, whereby one convolutional layer is replaced by a custom inception block. The architectures for each autoencoder are loosely based on prior work done by Oh et. al. <sup>2</sup> As a point of comparison, two other models (with and without an inception block) are built without the autoencoder component. Tuning of hyperparameters primarily involved adjusting the rate of dropout to 0%, 20%, 50%, and 80%."

        "A dataset with 1098 brain images from OASIS was used in this project. A download script was provided and the data was stored in Google Drive. With Google Colab, all images were preprocessed, standardized, and normalized. Visual inspection was done to ensure success of the alignment procedure to standard T1 images. Of the original set, 980 brain images were split into train, validation, and test sets in the ratio 80:10:10. The combination of T1 and T2 contrasts<sup>3</sup> deemed more difficult than expected, and so it was decided that the project proceed with T1 standard MRI images only.<br>\n",

        "After initial experimentation with early parts of our code, it became clear that our limited computational power on Google Colab was illfit for the full volumetric data of dimension (120, 160, 120). Based on domain knowledge, the decision was made to use slices of the images that represent the area of the ventricles known to have an association with Alzheimer's disease. This resulted in a more manageable dimensionality of (120, 160, 16). In order to improve our model with the limited dataset we have, data augmentation was employed via image rotation in random directions. To address class imbalance, the rarer class was weighted more heavily as compensation. The calculation determined a ratio of 1.36 AD : 0.79 CN."
